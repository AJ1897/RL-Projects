# D3QN Implementation for SEVN

This is a PyTorch implementation of
* Dueling Double Deep-Q Network [D3QN]

## Requirements

* Python 3 (it might work with Python 2, but I didn't test it)
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/)

In order to install requirements, follow:
```bash
# PyTorch
conda install pytorch torchvision -c soumith
```
## Run the code
```
python3 main.py --train_dqn
```
